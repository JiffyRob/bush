# Bush

Bush is  s et of utilities for making games in pygame.  It has all sorts of things in it:

- State machines

- Tiled map loading

- Animation classes

- Lazy asset loading

- Collision

- Effects for surfaces

- Entity classes

- Input binding

- Interfacing joystick with the system cursor

- Particle systems

- Basic physics

- Timers 

- And a bunch of other things too



### Are there docs?

Currently no.  This is still very WIP and is mainly for personal use.  



### Are there examples?

Yes.

- [particle benchmark](https://www.github.com/jiffyrob/exploding-cows)

- [WIP rpg game](https://github.com/jiffyrob/Treds-Adventure-v2)

- And probably more stuff as I use this more and more



### Will this be updated?

Yes.  As games are made with it, it is constantly getting better.  For the beginning of bush's life it was developed inside that aforementioned RPG game.  If you want to poke around at the commit list you'll see a lot of changes from when it was first created.
